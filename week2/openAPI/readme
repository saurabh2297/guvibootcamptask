Open API
https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all

fetchind dog breed list using xmlHTTP request 

also did the xmlHTTP request handling task in same.

when i verified before uploading on git (earlier it was working , maybe its a temporary server issue), noticed that api is not working 
, even tried visiting directly   , but it shows:-

"Error 503 Backend fetch failed
Backend fetch failed

Varnish L7 server"
that implies website is not functioning
