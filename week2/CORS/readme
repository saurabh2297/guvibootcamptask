resolved CORS error using a proxy server
https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com

The cors-anywhere server is a proxy that adds CORS headers to a request.
A proxy acts as an intermediary between a client and server.
In this case, the cors-anywhere proxy server operates in between the frontend web app making the request,
and the server that responds with data. 

it adds the more open Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * header to the response.
